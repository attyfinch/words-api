# words-api
In the near term this will be a public version of the API I built that powers [WordleAssist](https://github.com/attyfinch/wordle-assist). Wordle puzzle criteria sent via a POST request will return a list of possible correct answers ranked based on a scoring system I developed. I hope to have this completed before October 2023.

Over the longer term I plan on building out this API to encompass a variety of growing use cases. There are other word game solvers I would like to build, and there is a suprising lack of good word search and word filtering functionality in the world that I think should exist. My goal is to build an API and make it as broadly accessbile as possible.

As I build and launch functionality I will update this doc with documentation or links to documentation and other materials needed to successfully use it.
